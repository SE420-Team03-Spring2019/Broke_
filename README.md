# Broke_
Finance Tracker Application for SE310/SE420 Team Project

This repository includes design, implementation, and testing of a mobile appliaction written in C# using Xamarin.Forms and Visual Studio.


Installation Instructions:
	Download the solution project files contained in this repository.
  Ensure that the device that is running the solution has an updated version of Visual Studio 2017 with Xamarin.Forms .Net core installed       for C# development. This can be done by opening the Visual Studio Installer and selecting the desired options. Follow the         
      instructions from Visual Studio as it will likely require a reinstallation at this point if needed. 
  Ensure the android emulator is installed on the current version of Visual Studio and customize its settings to the desired device and         operating system. 
	Download the solution and all files from the ‘Broke_’ repository on GitHub and open the solution in Visual Studio. Build the project and        run on the emulator. 
  Eventually, the final version of the application would be deployed to an app store (Google Play) where the app could be installed like          any other mobile application.
